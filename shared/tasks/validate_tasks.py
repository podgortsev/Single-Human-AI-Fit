validate_tasks.py — an independent check of the shipped tasks.json.

No GPU. `python validate_tasks.py` reads tasks.json and re-derives the answer
from the QUESTION TEXT, not from the generator's variables.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
build_tasks.py has a verify() function, and for a while its docstring described
that function as "an independent solver". It is not one: it checks that a
numeric answer parses as a float, that the question ends in punctuation, and
that it is not absurdly short. Those are format checks. A generator that
computed the wrong key would pass all three.

This file is the independent solver the docstring claimed. It re-parses each
question out of the JSON and recomputes the answer with arithmetic written
separately from the generator, so a mistake would have to be made twice, in the
same direction, to survive.

It also checks the properties the generator does not guarantee:

  * every question is unique
  * no table task ties at the extreme it asks about
  * the answer key is reachable by exactly one reading of the question

WHAT IT FINDS ON THE SHIPPED DATASET
------------------------------------
Two things, both documented in the README and neither of which changes a
published number:

1. 200 rows contain 191 distinct questions. Nine rows are repeats of a question
   that already appears. They carry consistent answers, so no key is wrong, but
   "200 tasks" means 200 rows over 191 distinct items.

2. The date family is ambiguous between an inclusive and an exclusive reading
   of "runs for N days". The key uses the exclusive one. This shifts baseline
   accuracy and cancels in the paired design; see the note in the README.

The dataset is NOT regenerated to fix either. Every accuracy number in methods
3a, 3b and 3c was measured on these exact 200 rows.
